\chapter{Lay Summary}
Internet censorship prevents citizens of a country from accessing content on specific websites. Censors are powerful figures that restrict free access to information by limiting their citizens' internet access when they are within the censor's country. A proxy is a single hop beyond the reach of the censor that is controlled by an organization on the outside. A censored user connects to the proxy to hop outside of their country to view restricted content. There are not enough proxies for each censored user to have their own, so they must share. A censor may pretend to be honest to learn about the proxies to block access to them. This thesis presents an approach to proxy distribution that preserves some proxies by restricting their distribution. We examine the lifetime of proxies in a simulation to see if this solution is practical in a real-life setting.
