My work has the same goal as many trusted proxy distribution systems outlined in the related work in Section \ref{sec:related}; to provide service to clients in a hostile environment with practically an omnipotent censor entity. I propose a trust-less, lightweight approach to proxy distribution that relies on hiding random proxies in distribution rounds. The definition of \textit{best} varies as it is dependent on the state and goals of the system as shown in Table {\ref{tab:tradeoff}. 


Building trust requires storage of user statistics over time. Within anonymous systems, the assumption that any user can be trusted to build reputation is an extremely complex topic, both technically and ideologically. While it can be argued that seemingly all proxies provide a measure of anonymity because multiple users are aggregated on a single proxy, there exists a fundamental distrust of any proxy distribution system that persists user information, as it goes against the ethos of anonymity.
